We are extremely delighted to release **Multi-SWE-bench**! Multi-SWE-bench addresses the lack of multilingual benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in real-world code issue resolution. Unlike existing Python-centric benchmarks (e.g., SWE-bench), our framework spans ​7 languages (i.e., Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C, and C++) with ​1,632 high-quality instances, curated from 2,456 candidates by ​68 expert annotators for reliability.

We aim to accelerate progress in automated issue resolution and RL, bridging the gap toward AGI. Let's join the **Multi-SWE-RL community** to expand datasets, tools, and research collaboration!

## ⚡ Features

- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Evaluating nine powerful models (GPT-4o, OpenAI-o1, OpenAI-o3-mini-high, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, and Doubao-1.5-Pro) across three agent frameworks (Agentless, SWE-agent, OpenHands), yielding several valuable insights.  
- **Multi-SWE-RL Community**: Open-source initiative for large-scale RL datasets. Initial release includes **4723 instances** to advance RL research.  
- **Fully Open Source Data, Code, and Environment**: All data, code, and container images are publicly released, along with detailed tutorials, to foster community contributions and enable scalable extension.

## 📢 News
[2025/04/03]🔥We release [Multi-SWE-bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/Multi-SWE-bench) and [Multi-SWE-RL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/Multi-SWE-RL).

## 📊 Evaluation

### Run Evaluation

To run the evaluation, you need to prepare the following:

1. Patch Files: Some patch files in JSONL format, each item containing:
   - `org`: Organization Name
   - `repo`: Repository Name
   - `number`: Pull Request Number
   - `fix_patch`: Fix Patch Content
2. Dataset Files: Dataset files in JSONL format available on Hugging Face, such as [Multi-SWE-bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/Multi-SWE-bench) or [Multi-SWE-RL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/Multi-SWE-RL)
3. (Optional) Docker Images: You can download required Docker images using `scripts/download_images.ps1` (for Windows) or `scripts/download_images.sh` (for Linux/macOS) with either verified images or RL images:
   ```bash
   # For Windows
   .\scripts\download_images.ps1 scripts\images_verified.txt  # For verified images
   .\scripts\download_images.ps1 scripts\images_rl.txt        # For RL images
   
   # For Linux/macOS
   bash scripts/download_images.sh scripts/images_verified.txt  # For verified images
   bash scripts/download_images.sh scripts/images_rl.txt        # For RL images
   ```
   This step is optional. If images don't exist locally, they will be built during evaluation.

Then you can run the evaluation using the following command:

```bash
python -m multi_swe_bench.harness.run_evaluation --config /path/to/your/config.json
```

The evaluation process will generate a `final_report.json` file in your specified `output_dir`, which provides a summary of results including resolved_instances, unresolved_instances, and other metrics. For detailed information about failed instances and specific error reasons, you can check the log files in the `log_dir` directory.

#### Configuration File Example

```json
{
    "mode": "evaluation",
    "workdir": "./data/workdir",
    "patch_files": [
        "./data/patches/<your_patch_file>.jsonl"

    ],
    "force_build": false,
    "output_dir": "./data/dataset",
    "specifics": [],
    "skips": [],
    "repo_dir": "./data/repos",
    "need_clone": false,
    "global_env": [],
    "clear_env": true,
    "stop_on_error": true,
    "max_workers": 8,
    "max_workers_build_image": 8,
    "max_workers_run_instance": 8,
    "log_dir": "./data/logs",
    "log_level": "DEBUG"
}
```
